# 📰 Fake News Predictor

A Machine Learning based application that predicts whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Fake News Predictor is a supervised machine learning project built using **Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn**.  

It analyzes the textual content of news articles provided by the user and classifies them as:

- ✅ Real News  
- ❌ Fake News  

The model is trained on labeled news data and uses text vectorization techniques to convert raw text into numerical features before making predictions.
